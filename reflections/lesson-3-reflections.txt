When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

whenever you need to share or access code apart from your local machine. also, to store an extra copy of the code somewhere that is safe

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

it allows the developer to pull changes whenever he/she is ready to pull changes from a remote. otherwise, pulled changes may interfere with code in progress. also the developer is able to be aware of what changes were pulled
