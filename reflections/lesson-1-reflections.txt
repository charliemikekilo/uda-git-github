How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it identified the differences between each file on a per line basis
the differences were labeled by what was added and removed and which files were evaluated against each other

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

the pros:
meaningful commits
commits mark a significant point in development

the cons:
too few commits or too many commits
user may have poor commit habits including committing after too much or too little work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

it allows for a synchronized snapshot of the project's progress

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

see what lines of code changed in case there's a need to revert to a previous version

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

it allows the project to have saved snapshots to refer back to in case there's an issue or something that needs to be revisited
